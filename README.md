# Multi-Client-Chat-Communication-using-Socket-Programming-in-Java
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a client-server communication model using Java Socket Programming, enabling multiple clients to interact with a server simultaneously. The system comprises two main modules: the server (mserver.java / Server.java) and the client (mclient.java / Client.java). It establishes a TCP-based connection where the server listens for client requests, processes them, and sends appropriate responses back.
The server module functions as a host that continuously listens for incoming connections on a specific port (9999). Once a client attempts to connect, the server accepts the request and spawns a new thread (ServerThread) dedicated to handling communication with that particular client. This multithreaded design ensures that multiple clients can communicate with the server concurrently without interfering with each other’s sessions. Each client message is received through a data input stream, processed, and then echoed back as a response using an output stream. The connection persists until the client sends a termination command, typically "QUIT".
On the other hand, the client module initiates communication by connecting to the server’s IP and port. Clients can send messages to the server via a console-based interface. The client reads responses in real time, demonstrating full-duplex communication between both ends. The design emphasizes simplicity and efficiency in socket interaction, including handling input/output streams and connection lifecycle management.
This project highlights key network programming concepts such as socket creation, data transmission through streams, multithreading, synchronization, and exception handling. It also strengthens understanding of TCP/IP communication fundamentals and provides a practical foundation for developing advanced applications like chat servers, multiplayer games, or collaborative tools.
Overall, this project serves as an excellent example of how to build a robust client-server architecture in Java, promoting efficient data exchange between multiple clients and a central server in real time.
